# LetsCountdown

A desktop Countdown app which can count down to a particular day or time and the user can see the time (weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) decreasing until the D-Day. The user can create multiple countdown timers for as many events as they want. Each timer will be highly customizable by the user as they can choose the text color, background color, the entities that they want to see, the sound they want to hear as the countdown finishes and a cool clipart to go with the event.

The app was made using Java and JavaFX and it follows the MVC design pattern. The app has login and registering user functionality and it uses Serialization to implement persistent storage. This app was developed keeping accessibility in mind and is also internationalized to be used in Spanish.
